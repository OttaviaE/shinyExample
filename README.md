# Shiny tutorial

This is a brief tutorial on the basic functioning of `shiny`. 

- The `psicoStat.Rmd` file is the file used for thre presentation done for the Psico Stat group. In that file, you can find all the comment code for creating different shiny apps, embeded in a `Rmd` file.

- The `shinyExample.Rproj` is the `R` project with which the `ui.R` and `server.R` file has been created.

- `ui.R` contains the User Interface of an example app.

- `server.R` contains the server for the example app.

- `style.css` contains the CSS code for the example app.

If you want to try the app locally, you should download the `shinyExample.Rproj`, `ui.R`, `server.ui`, and `style.css` and save them in the same work directory. 

Make use you have `shiny`, `shinyjs`, and `shinythemes` packages installed before running the app.
